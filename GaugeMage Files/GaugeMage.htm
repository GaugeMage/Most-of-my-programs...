            </p>
            <p>
                There are different types of tools and weapons that the Ultimate GaugeMage uses.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first type are sparklers. Sparklers are the most common type of weapon that associates in electrickery. They are the cheapest type of weapon.    
            </p>
            <p>
                The second types are sticks. Sticks are mostly used for utility. They are uncommon and cost more than sparklers.
            </p>
            <p>
                The next type are staffs. Staffs are a combination of sparklers and sticks. They are used for weaponry and utility. They are meant for the royal. They are the rarest and are really expensive.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another type is a Sp-Hybrid. It's a mixture of a sparkler and a staff.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another type is a St-Hybrid. It's a mixture of a stick and staff.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Last type is the Ult-Staffs. The Ult Staffs are the ultimate staffs and if you possess one of them you will become one of the Ultimate GaugeMages. You are probobly wondering... What is an Ultimate GaugeMage. Well an Ultimate GaugeMage is a GaugeMage which is more powerful than the rest of the GaugeMages. Right now you must be thinking this. "I already know that GaugeMages are strong and awesome but now there are ULTIMATE GAUGEMAGES!" There is something else about Ult-Staffs. Ult-Staffs helped create the world!
            </p>
            <p>
                GaugeMages usually have a sparkler and a stick. If you own a Sp-Hybrid or a St-Hybrid you should get a staff. If you have a staff that is all you need.

                    Thw Ultimate Gauge-Dark Staff is the most devasting of the staffs. This staff created darkness. If you reverse the Ultimate Gauge-Dark Staff with the Gauge S Sp-Hybrid you can make it create light! That is why if you own this Ult-Staff it is handy to own the Gauge-S Sp-Hybrid.

                    The Ultimate Gauge-Intel Staff is used to make the stupid, wise. It is to  be or not to be. Is that the question? Sorry for messing with you. The Ultimate Gauge-Intel Staff is also used for making magic missiles. If you haven't noticed already there is a blue ball in the center of the Ult-Staff. It is the last of its race. It will help you make disicions.
